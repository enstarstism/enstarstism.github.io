## N.10 - Analog Horror         (also known as VHS Horror, Found Footage and Found Footage Horror)

---

Analog/Analogue Horror is the older counterpart of Digital Horror and a subgenre of Found Footage, which incorporates old "analog" styled media such as TV Broadcasts, VHS Tapes, and EAS while including horror elements that evoke feelings of dread, fear, and uncanniness.

### Visuals
While visuals vary, the main visual of Analog Horror consists of old styled footage with glitchy, static effects.

A majority of TV Broadcast or commercial analogs usually contain a deep blue color palette or a blank background of any color. They also contain a schedule of shows that are going to be broadcasted and display the time, which usually take place between 12 AM - 5 AM.

Distorted, warped and blackened faces are another common reoccurring visual. These faces are often heavily shadowed and use the "sharpen" effect. The faces also display twisted, sinister and unnatural expressions and contain extremely detailed features.

Space imagery also appears in many Analog Horror videos, often in a sinister light, such as the planets and the moon in Gemini Home Entertainment and the moon in Local 58.
