## N.2 - Analog Horror         (also known as VHS Horror, Found Footage and Found Footage Horror)

---

**Analog/Analogue Horror** is the older counterpart of [Digital Horror](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Digital_Horror) and a subgenre of **Found Footage**, which incorporates old "analog" styled media such as TV Broadcasts, VHS Tapes, and EAS while including horror elements that evoke feelings of dread, fear, and uncanniness.

### Visuals
While visuals vary, the main visual of Analog Horror consists of old styled footage with glitchy, static effects.

A majority of TV Broadcast or commercial analogs usually contain a **deep blue color palette or a blank background of any color**. They also contain a schedule of shows that are going to be broadcasted and display the time, which usually take place between 12 AM - 5 AM.

Distorted, warped and blackened faces are another common reoccurring visual. These faces are often heavily shadowed and use the "sharpen" effect. The faces also display twisted, sinister and unnatural expressions and contain extremely detailed features.

Space imagery also appears in many Analog Horror videos, often in a sinister light, such as the planets and the moon in **Gemini Home Entertainment** and the moon in **Local 58**.

## N.1 - Cybercore         (also known as Cyber Y2K, Y2K Futurism, Y3K (in Japan), Kaybug)

---

**Cybercore** (also known as **Cyber Y2K or Y3K**, and originally just Y2K before semantic shift) is an aesthetic that was prevalent in popular culture from roughly 1997 to 2004, succeeding the **[Memphis Design](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Memphis_Design) and [Grunge](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Grunge)** eras and overlapping with the **[McBling](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/McBling), [UrBling](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/UrBling), [Surf Crush](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Surf_Crush), and [2K1](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/2K1) aesthetics**. Some of its aspects include tight leather pants, shiny clothing, silver eye shadow, spiky up-dos, Oakleys, gradients, translucence, and Blobitecture. Cybercore relies on the use of technology and slick futuristic looks, **signaling the optimism for the 3rd Millennium or 21st Century**.

Cybercore is mostly classified as a subcategory to [Retro-Futurism](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Retro-Futurism), but some elements also cross over with Vaporwave, since it shares [Vaporwave](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Vaporwave)'s angst towards late-stage capitalism, and its nostalgia for a future that never came.

## History


Cybercore has its origins in the **underground UK rave scene of the late '80s/Early '90s** (i.e. The Prodigy, Aphex Twin, The Future Sound of London), as well as the early works of the Sheffield-based [Designers Republic](https://www.thedesignersrepublic.com/). The first signs of the Cybercore aesthetic going **mainstream appeared around 1995 to 1996**, with the release of Windows 95, the start of the Internet boom, the original PlayStation and Nintendo 64 being released with games such as Wipeout and Super Mario 64, Pokemon being released in Japan, the films Hackers, Trainspotting, and Scream being released, artists like the Spice Girls, Robyn, Moloko, and Backstreet Boys debuting in Europe, and the music video for Michael and Janet Jackson's "Scream". Campaigns like Nintendo's "Play It Loud" era might have been a precursor to Cybercore, as well.

### Graphics and Art
Cybercore aesthetics use both graphic design and CGI. Graphic designs usually feature thick lines, bold minimalism, and heavy use of iconography. CGI art is more blobby looking, having more gradients in contrast to Metalheart or [Chromecore](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Chromecore). Common colors used in Cybercore art are, but not limited to, [chrome, icy blue, ocean, bright oranges, glossy white, and black (for linework)](https://twitter.com/crossniq/status/1156648479273431040).

One of the earliest definers of the Cybercore aesthetic is the Designers Republic, a Sheffield-based graphic design studio best known for their work on the video game series Wipeout as well as various album artwork, especially for artists on the electronica label Warp Records. Founded by Ian Anderson and Nick Phillips in 1986, they were best known for making art that subverts brash consumerism and the uniformity of corporate culture. Like Vaporwave, much of their work also drew inspiration from Japanese anime, which was beginning to rise in popularity around the same time.
